# Clustering Depression Screening Data
In this exercise, I used k-means cluster analysis to segment respondents of the NHANES PHQ-9 depression screening into groups and successfully isolated respondents who displayed moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms into a group for further analysis. The process included exploring demographic features, comparing cluster results on given features vs extracted features (PCA), and using Sum of Squares and Silhouette Scores to find optimal cluster values. Further analysis of the isolated group revealed comparatively low income-to-poverty ratios as a distinguishing feature.
